### 1. [Smart City Lighting Project](https://github.com/yenijung/smart-city-project.git)
>This project explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and urban planning to improve energy efficiency in smart city infrastructure. By utilizing a hybrid AI model that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), this research predicts streetlight energy consumption based on weather patterns. The aim is to optimize energy usage while maintaining sustainability in urban lighting systems.
